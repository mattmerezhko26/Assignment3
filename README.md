**Project Title:** "Climate Solutions App"

**Project Description:**

This project builds upon the foundation of PetProjectV1 by creating a more user-friendly web application. It features a custom landing page with links to various climate change solutions, an "About" page with information about the creator, and a custom 404 error page. The application leverages Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling, providing a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The server has been enhanced to support dynamic routes, handle query parameters for filtering project data, and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
